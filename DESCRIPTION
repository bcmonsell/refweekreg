Description: Generates reference week regressors to include in time series models. 
    These refernce week regressors are indicator variables that have a 1 if the week 
    a given US holiday occurs in is a reference week, 0 otherwise. 
    Routines also generate the day that starts the reference week 
    (usually the week that contains the 12th of the month). 
    Another routine generates a 4 or 5 week regressor used to calendar adjust
    selected CES series.
